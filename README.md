In the name of god

Title of project: OX
If you're looking for a comfortable platform to play xo , OX is the best choice.:)

What does it do?-
When you join the OX, you'll see a list of online users. So choose your opponent, send a request to him/her, then play?. Also you can chat with your opponent during the game. 3 different  game fields are prepared for you and you have a limited time for each one.

The technologies we used in our project:-
The most important  libraries  used, are < boost::asio.hpp>  and  <thread> . for  graphical design we used < windows.h >. 


-Features we implement in this project that make it stand out:
1-we implement some options for after game ,including rematch, chat  and exit. after the game is finished, both players can send a request  to another, for each option. 
1-1- In case of rematch, the turns will be changed.
1-2-in chat room you can chat with your opponent easily and if you want to exit the chat, just type EXIT. 
2-we changed the timer structure.so now  each game field, has a unique total time.(field1 ->1:30 min ,field2->2:30 min,field3->3:30 min).if your time is  less than 20 seconds, you'll see a red beeping timer?.
3-in case of any disconnection ,the other player will win.
4-at the beginning of the program you'll see OX logo which has animated colors.
5-and at the end, we say goodbye to you in Morse language. 


-Features we hope to implement in the future:
1-First of all, this OX server accepts only 2 clients at a time. This program can be implemented to accept plenty of clients and run some concurrent games.
2-The option of "new game" doesn't exist now. So it's a good idea to be implemented  later ; so users can send a request to a new opponent to play. 
3-The chat room also needs to be improved. For example adding  end-to-end encryption system. 
Or features that provide editing or removing  massages.
4-more graphical features  make it more lovely.


-How to use OX?
the only thing you have to do, is to install boost library. Then just run it and enjoy playing with your friends.
