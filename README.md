# OX

If you're looking for a comfortable platform to play xo , OX is the best choice.:)

### What does it do?
When you join the OX, you'll see a list of online users. So choose your opponent, send a request to him/her, then play?. Also you can chat with your opponent during the game. 3 different  game fields are prepared for you and you have a limited time for each one.<br /><br />

### The technologies we used in our project:
The most important  libraries  used, are < boost::asio.hpp>  and  <thread> . for  graphical design we used < windows.h >. <br /><br />
          

### Features we implement in this project that make it stand out:
1-we implement some options for after game ,including rematch, chat  and exit. after the game is finished, both players can send a request  to another, for each option. <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1-1- In case of rematch, the turns will be changed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1-2-in chat room you can chat with your opponent easily and if you want to exit the chat, just type EXIT. <br />
2-we changed the timer structure.so now  each game field, has a unique total time.(field1 ->1:30 min ,field2->2:30 min,field3->3:30 min).if your time is  less than 20 seconds, you'll see a red beeping timer?.<br />
3-in case of any disconnection ,the other player will win.<br />
4-at the beginning of the program you'll see OX logo which has animated colors.<br />
5-and at the end, we say goodbye to you in Morse language. <br /><br />


### Features we hope to implement in the future:
1-First of all, this OX server accepts only 2 clients at a time. This program can be implemented to accept plenty of clients and run some concurrent games.<br />
2-The option of "new game" doesn't exist now. So it's a good idea to be implemented  later ; so users can send a request to a new opponent to play. <br />
3-The chat room also needs to be improved. For example adding  end-to-end encryption system. <br />
Or features that provide editing or removing  massages.<br />
4-more graphical features  make it more lovely.<br /><br />


### How to use OX?
the only thing you have to do, is to install boost library. Then just run it and enjoy playing with your friends.
